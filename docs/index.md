# Introduction 

This is a C# WPF Tool to remind the user to change his stance from sitting to standing and vice versa.

I have built this for my office time to not sit all day, but to change my desk for standing while working and get the blood flowing again.

# Build and Test

Open the solution in your IDE and build it.
